# Library-Management-System
This system  includes a database that stores information about library materials, such as books, journals, 
and multimedia resources, as well as data about library users, such as their borrowing history and contact 
information.

The key features of a library management system include:

1. Cataloging: This feature allows librarians to enter and maintain information about library materials, such as 
title, author, publication information, and subject headings, and assign unique identifiers to each item.

2. Reporting: This feature generates reports on library usage, circulation statistics, and inventory management.

3. Search and discovery: This feature enables users to search the library catalog for materials, place holds and reservations,
and access online resources such as e-books and databases.
